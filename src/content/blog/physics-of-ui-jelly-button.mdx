# Why Does Software Feel Stiff?

Most software moves linearly. You click a button, it changes color instantly. You open a modal, it slides in at a constant speed. But nothing in the real world moves like that.

In the real world, things have mass. They have friction. They have tension. When you push something, it resists. When you let go, it might bounce back.

## Enter Spring Physics

The `JellyButton` component in my design system is an attempt to bring that organic feel to the web. Instead of defining a duration (e.g., "animate for 0.3s"), we define physical properties:

*   **Stiffness:** How rigid is the spring?
*   **Damping:** How quickly does the energy dissipate?
*   **Mass:** How heavy is the object?

## The Jelly Effect

To achieve the "jelly" look, we're not just scaling the button. We're distorting it.

When the mouse presses down, we squash the button on the Y-axis and stretch it on the X-axis. When the mouse releases, the spring physics take over, causing it to wobble back to its original shape.

```tsx
<motion.button
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.9, rotate: -2 }}
  transition={{ type: "spring", stiffness: 400, damping: 17 }}
>
  Click Me
</motion.button>
```

## Why "Feel" Matters

This might seem like a trivial detail. Who cares if a button wobbles?

But these micro-interactions accumulate. They tell the user that the interface is responsive, that it's "listening." It creates a sense of playfulness and polish that distinguishes a good app from a great one.

It turns a tool into a toy, in the best possible way.
