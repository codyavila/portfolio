# Hello World

It's a cliché, I know. But every project needs a beginning.

For years, I've treated my online presence as a static resume. A place to say "I built this thing, please hire me." It was functional, but it was also... silent.

I want this space to be different.

## The Digital Garden

I'm a big believer in the concept of a [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). Unlike a traditional blog, where posts are polished, final artifacts, a garden is a place for growth. Some ideas here will be fully formed. Others will be seedlings—rough notes, experiments, and questions I'm trying to answer.

## What to Expect

If you're here, you're probably interested in the intersection of **design** and **engineering**. That's where I live.

You can expect posts about:
- **Creative Coding**: Shaders, canvas, and making the browser do things it wasn't meant to do.
- **Design Systems**: The architecture of UI, from tokens to component APIs.
- **Accessibility**: Making sure the cool stuff is usable by everyone.
- **Process**: The messy reality of building software, not just the shiny final result.

## Let's Build

This site itself is an experiment. It's built with Next.js, Tailwind, and a lot of curiosity. It will break. It will change. And I'll be writing about it as it happens.

Welcome to the lab.
