# Over-Engineering or Future-Proofing?

Is it overkill to build a full design system for a personal website? Probably.
Did I do it anyway? Absolutely.

## The "Why"

I treat my portfolio as a playground, but also as a product. I want to be able to spin up a new project page or a new blog post in minutes, not hours. I don't want to be hard-coding hex values or fiddling with margins every time I have an idea.

## The Core Tokens

It started with the basics:
*   **Colors:** Semantic naming (`bg-primary`, `text-muted`) rather than descriptive (`blue-500`, `gray-200`). This made implementing Dark Mode trivial.
*   **Typography:** A fluid type scale that adapts to viewport width.
*   **Spacing:** A strict 4px grid.

## Component Composition

I adopted a "Compound Component" pattern for things like the `BlogCard` and `ProjectCard`.

```tsx
<Card>
  <Card.Header>
    <Card.Title>My Project</Card.Title>
  </Card.Header>
  <Card.Content>
    ...
  </Card.Content>
</Card>
```

This gives me flexibility. If I want a card without a header, I just don't render it. The styles are encapsulated, but the layout is composable.

## The Payoff

Now, when I want to add a new section, it feels like playing with LEGOs. I grab a `SectionDivider`, drop in a `BentoGrid`, fill it with `GlassCards`, and I'm done.

It required more upfront effort, but the velocity it gives me now is worth every second.
