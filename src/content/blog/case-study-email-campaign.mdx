A multi-step wizard that simplified complex campaign setups, reducing user error and increasing successful launches.

**Role:** Lead Frontend Engineer  
**Timeline:** 3 Months  
**Tech Stack:** React, React Query, TypeScript, Zod

## The Problem

Users were struggling to configure email campaigns correctly. The existing interface was a monolithic form with poor validation, leading to:

- **High configuration error rate** requiring support intervention
- **"Black box" scheduling logic** that frustrated users
- **Slow UI performance** due to unnecessary network requests

The support team was overwhelmed, and users were abandoning campaign creation mid-flow.

---

## The Solution

I led cross-functional discovery and defined the product requirements for a new **multi-step wizard** that guided users through the process, validating each step before proceeding.

### Natural Language Scheduling

Replaced complex cron-like selectors with a human-readable summary:

> "Sends every Monday at 9:00 AM"

This immediate feedback loop drastically reduced scheduling errors. Users could finally *see* what they were configuring without mental translation.

### Granular Validation

Leveraged React Hook Form and Zod to validate inputs in real-time:

- Field-level validation with instant feedback
- Step-level validation preventing progression with errors
- Clear error messages in plain language

### Optimistic Updates

Used React Query to manage server state:

- **Optimistic updates** for immediate UI feedback
- **Request deduping** to cut network overhead
- **Smart caching** to persist state across navigation

## The Results

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Support Tickets | **30% reduction** in configuration-related issues |
| Campaign Launches | Significant increase in successful launches |
| User Feedback | Positive reception from editorial teams |

The wizard pattern proved so successful it became the template for other complex configuration flows in the product.

## Key Learnings

1. **Progressive disclosure wins** — Don't show everything at once. Guide users through complexity step by step.

2. **Immediate feedback reduces anxiety** — Real-time validation and natural language summaries help users feel confident.

3. **Invest in state management** — React Query's caching and optimistic updates made the UI feel instant despite network operations.
