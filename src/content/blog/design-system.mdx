# I Hate Boring Websites

Okay, "hate" is a strong word. Let's say I'm *bored* by them.

You know the look: stark white background, Helvetica font, a grid of static images, and a "Contact Me" button that does absolutely nothing when you hover over it. It’s clean. It’s professional. It’s... asleep.

When I started building this portfolio, I made a promise to myself: **I am not going to build a digital resume. I am going to build a digital playground.**

I call it **Project Luminous**.

<Callout type="insight" title="The Mission">
  The goal wasn't just to show my work. It was to make you *feel* something while you looked at it. I wanted the site to have mass, friction, and maybe a little bit of attitude.
</Callout>

Here is how I turned a standard React app into a living, breathing ecosystem—and how you can too.

## 1. If It Ain't Squishy, It Ain't Right

In the real world, things don't just slide linearly from A to B. If you throw a ball, it bounces. If you poke a marshmallow, it squishes.

So why do our buttons feel like concrete blocks?

I decided that every interaction needed to feel physical. I replaced standard CSS transitions with **spring physics**. When you click a button here, it doesn't just change color—it compresses. It fights back.

<Steps>
  <Step title="The Press">
    The button scales down, but gets wider (conservation of mass!).
  </Step>
  <Step title="The Release">
    It snaps back, overshooting slightly before settling.
  </Step>
  <Step title="The Result">
    Dopamine. Pure, unadulterated dopamine.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<ComponentPreview title="Squish Physics" description="Click these buttons to feel the conservation of mass">
  <div className="flex gap-4 justify-center p-8">
    <JellyButton variant="primary">Squish Me</JellyButton>
    <JellyButton variant="secondary">Me Too</JellyButton>
  </div>
</ComponentPreview>

## 2. Glass That Actually Glows

"Glassmorphism" had a moment a few years ago, then everyone realized it was a performance nightmare and stopped.

I didn't stop. I doubled down.

But I didn't want just "frosted glass." I wanted **bioluminescent glass**. I wanted cards that felt like they were lit from within, reacting to your mouse like it was a light source.

<Grid cols={2}>
  <GridItem title="The Look">
    Deep, dark backgrounds with neon accents that bleed through the glass.
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem title="The Tech">
    Real-time mouse tracking that paints radial gradients on the fly.
  </GridItem>
</Grid>

<ComponentPreview title="Interactive Glass" description="Hover over the card to see the spotlight follow your cursor">
  <div className="flex justify-center p-8">
    <GlassCard className="p-8 max-w-sm" enableSpotlight={true} enableTilt={true}>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Bioluminescence</h3>
      <div className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
        This card tracks your mouse position and updates a radial gradient in real-time.
      </div>
    </GlassCard>
  </div>
</ComponentPreview>

It turns out, making glass look good without melting your GPU is an art form.

## 3. The Sound of Silence (is Boring)

I know, I know. "Websites shouldn't have sound."

Counterpoint: **Video games have sound.** Apps have sound. Your toaster has sound. Why is the web the only silent medium?

The trick is subtlety. No autoplaying techno beats. Just tiny, satisfying *clicks*, *thuds*, and *whooshes* that confirm your actions. It adds a tactile dimension that visuals alone can't achieve.

  <SoundPalette />
</ComponentPreview>

<Callout type="warning">
  **Rule #1 of Web Audio:** If the user mutes their computer, the site must still work perfectly. Sound is a garnish, not the main course.
</Callout>

Curious how I built a synthesizer in the browser?

## 4. Painting with Math

See that background? The one that looks like moving smoke or a lava lamp?

That's not a video. It's not a GIF. It's a **Fragment Shader**.

It's a tiny program running on your graphics card, calculating the color of every single pixel in real-time, 60 times a second. It's math masquerading as art. And it is surprisingly easy to get started with.

## 5. Accessibility is Not Optional

Here's the catch: When you make things neon, squishy, and loud, you risk alienating people.

*   Motion sickness?
*   Screen readers?
*   Color blindness?

I spent just as much time on the "boring" stuff—ARIA labels, focus states, reduced motion preferences—as I did on the shiny stuff. Because the coolest website in the world sucks if you can't use it.

## The Verdict

Project Luminous is my answer to the "flat web." It's a collection of experiments, failures, and small victories.

It's not perfect. It's a little chaotic. It's definitely "extra."

But it's **me**.

And if you're building a portfolio, that's the only metric that matters. Don't build what you think a recruiter wants to see. Build the internet you want to browse.
