# Introduction

Welcome to my new portfolio! I built this site to showcase my work and experiments with creative coding.

## The Tech Stack

I chose **Next.js** for its performance and developer experience. For styling, I'm using **Tailwind CSS** because it allows me to iterate quickly.

But the real star of the show is the custom shader background.

## Sound Design

One detail I'm particularly proud of is the audio feedback system. Instead of the typical "8-bit" bleeps and bloops you often hear in web UI, I wanted something more refined—closer to modern iOS/macOS system sounds.

### The Approach

The key to making synthesized sounds feel organic rather than retro:

1. **Low-pass filtering** — Every sound runs through a filter to remove harsh high frequencies
2. **Dynamics compression** — A compressor smooths out volume spikes for a polished feel
3. **Pink noise layers** — Subtle noise bursts add tactile texture to clicks and impacts
4. **Simulated reverb** — Delay-based reverb gives sounds space and depth
5. **Detuned oscillators** — Multiple oscillators with slight pitch differences create warmth

### Implementation

Here's a simplified example of how I create a warm, filtered tone:

```tsx
const createWarmOsc = (ctx: AudioContext, freq: number, detune: number = 0) => {
  const osc = ctx.createOscillator();
  const filter = ctx.createBiquadFilter();
  const gain = ctx.createGain();
  
  osc.type = "sine";
  osc.frequency.value = freq;
  osc.detune.value = detune; // Slight detuning for warmth
  
  // Soft low-pass filter removes harsh overtones
  filter.type = "lowpass";
  filter.frequency.value = 2000;
  filter.Q.value = 0.5;
  
  osc.connect(filter);
  filter.connect(gain);
  
  return { osc, filter, gain };
};
```

The result is a sound palette that feels modern, subtle, and satisfying without being distracting.

## Code Snippet Example

Here is how I set up a simple React component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';

export const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg">
      Hello, World!
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Custom Components

I can also use custom components directly in my markdown!

<JellyButton className="bg-purple-500 hover:bg-purple-600 text-white">
  Click Me!
</JellyButton>

Stay tuned for more updates!
