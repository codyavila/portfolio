# The "Technical" in Technical Product Manager

There's a debate in the industry: Does a PM need to know how to code?

My answer is: You don't *need* to, but it changes everything if you do.

Transitioning from Front End Engineer to TPM, I realized my biggest asset wasn't my ability to write Jira tickets—it was my ability to read the codebase.

## Speaking the Language

When an engineer tells me, "That's going to be a heavy refactor," I don't just hear "it will take a long time." I visualize the dependency graph. I understand the risk of regression. I know *why* it's hard.

This shared language builds trust. Engineers know I'm not just throwing requirements over the wall. I'm considering the implementation cost.

## Better Trade-offs

Product management is the art of trade-offs. Speed vs. Quality. Scope vs. Time.

Because I understand the tech stack, I can propose creative solutions.
*   "If we drop this specific animation requirement, can we use the existing component and ship 3 days earlier?"
*   "I know the API already returns this data, so adding it to the UI shouldn't require backend work, right?"

## Empathy for the On-Call

I've been the one waking up at 3 AM for a PagerDuty alert. I know the stress of a broken build.

As a PM, this makes me protective of my team's time. I fight against scope creep not just because of the timeline, but because I know the human cost of "crunch time."

## The Trap

The danger, of course, is trying to be the "Solution Architect" instead of the PM. I have to constantly remind myself: **Define the 'What' and the 'Why', let the team define the 'How'.**

My coding background is a tool for empathy and communication, not for control.
