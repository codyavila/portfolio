# Cody Avila - Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
It showcases my transition from Frontend Engineering to Product Management.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

- `src/app/page.tsx`: The main landing page.
- `src/app/layout.tsx`: The root layout and metadata.
- `src/app/globals.css`: Global styles and Tailwind configuration.

## Customization

To update the content, edit `src/app/page.tsx`.
To add new case studies, consider creating a new route (e.g., `src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`) or adding them to the `page.tsx` for now.
