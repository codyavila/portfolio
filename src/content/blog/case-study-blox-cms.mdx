Rebuilding the core content management system for over 2,000 media organizations, focusing on performance, scalability, and editorial workflow efficiency.

**Role:** Lead Frontend Engineer  
**Scale:** 141M+ Monthly Users  
**Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, MUI, Next.js

## The Challenge

BLOX Digital powers digital transformation for thousands of media organizations. The legacy systems needed to evolve to handle massive scale (6.8B+ annual pageviews) while providing a modern, efficient experience for editorial teams.

The core issues we faced:

- **Rapid feature delivery needs** across multiple teams with inconsistent patterns
- **Inconsistent UI/UX patterns** slowing down editorial workflows
- **Performance bottlenecks** impacting user productivity
- **Tech debt** at critical levels limiting scalability

## The Solution

I drove the product strategy and technical execution of the BLOX NXT CMS, aligning cross-functional stakeholders around a modular architecture and scalable design system.

### Design System & Component Library

Established a reusable component library and lightweight design system. This standardized UI patterns and accelerated feature delivery by approximately 30% across teams.

The key was creating components that were:
- Flexible enough for varied use cases
- Opinionated enough to maintain consistency
- Well-documented for team adoption

### Performance Optimization

Improved perceived performance through:
- Render profiling to identify bottlenecks
- Strategic memoization of expensive computations
- Request batching to reduce network overhead

### Editorial Workflow Enhancements

Built data-driven dashboards and real-time authoring affordances. Shipped 20+ customer-visible features across content authoring, audience, and analytics workflows.

## The Results

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Feature Delivery | **30% faster** with standardized components |
| Paid Subscribers | Architected payment integrations supporting **2M+ subscribers** |
| API Contracts | Standardized resilient flows across services |

The design system became the foundation for consistent, rapid development across the entire platform—enabling teams to ship faster while maintaining quality.
