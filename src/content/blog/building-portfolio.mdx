# The Blank Canvas Problem

Every developer knows this feeling: you open a new project, stare at the empty folder, and think *"this time it'll be different."*

I'd been meaning to rebuild my portfolio for... let's say *a while*. The old one was fine. Functional. Boring. It showed my work but didn't show *me*.

This time, I wanted to build something I'd actually be proud of.

---

## Week 1: The Rabbit Hole

I started where every developer starts: research. "Just a few hours of inspiration gathering," I told myself.

Three days later, I had:
- 47 browser tabs open
- A Figma file with 12 competing directions
- Zero lines of code
- Strong opinions about the state of portfolio design

Most portfolios fell into two camps:

<Grid cols={2}>
  <GridItem>
    **Camp A: The Minimalist**
    White background. Helvetica. A grid of rectangles. Clean? Yes. Memorable? No.
  </GridItem>
  <GridItem>
    **Camp B: The Showoff**
    Every WebGL trick in the book. Parallax on parallax. Loading screens for loading screens. Cool for 30 seconds, then exhausting.
  </GridItem>
</Grid>

I wanted a third option: something that felt *alive* without feeling like a theme park.

## The "Aha" Moment

It happened at 2am, watching a nature documentary. (Don't judge—this is peak developer behavior.)

The episode was about bioluminescence. Deep-sea creatures glowing in the darkness. And it hit me:

<Callout type="insight" title="The Core Concept">
  What if interfaces could glow like that? Not garish neon signs, but organic light that *emanates* from within?
</Callout>

I scribbled some notes:
- Purple-tinted darkness (not harsh black)
- Colors that feel like they emit light
- Motion that feels organic, not mechanical
- Glass surfaces that refract and blur

That became the foundation of [Project Luminous](/blog/creating-project-luminous)—the design system powering this site.

## Week 2: The Shader Saga

I knew I wanted an animated background. Video felt heavy. GIFs felt cheap. So naturally, I decided to write a custom WebGL shader.

I had never written a shader before.

<ComponentPreview title="The Result" description="Real-time procedural noise—no video files">
  <ShaderGradient />
</ComponentPreview>

What looks simple took an embarrassing amount of time. The learning curve was steep:

**Day 1:** "How hard can GLSL be?"  
**Day 3:** "Why is everything pink?"  
**Day 5:** "Finally! It works! ...on Chrome."  
**Day 7:** "Safari, why do you hate me?"

The breakthrough came when I stopped trying to be clever. Simple layered noise, mapped to a color palette. No fancy raymarching, no volumetric fog. Just the minimum needed for that flowing, aurora-like effect.

## The Spring Physics Obsession

Somewhere around week 3, I became unreasonably fixated on animation easing.

It started innocently. A button hover felt *off*. Not wrong, just... lifeless. I swapped `ease-in-out` for a spring curve and suddenly the button had *weight*.

<ComponentPreview title="The Difference" description="Duration-based vs. spring physics">
  <DurationVsSpring />
</ComponentPreview>

One button became every button. Then every card. Then every page transition. I banned linear easing entirely.

The obsession paid off. Springs make everything feel tactile—like the interface has mass and momentum. It's subtle, but once you see it, you can't unsee it.

## Week 4: Sound Design Detour

"What if buttons made sounds?"

Famous last words.

I thought it would take an afternoon. Add some click sounds, done. But every sound library I found had the same problem: they sounded like 2005. Harsh, synthetic, annoying.

I wanted sounds that felt like a premium operating system. iOS notifications. MacOS clicks. That subtle, satisfying *thunk*.

<ComponentPreview title="The Difference" description="Harsh synth vs. filtered warmth (sound on)">
  <SoundCompare />
</ComponentPreview>

So I learned the Web Audio API and synthesized everything from scratch. Low-pass filters. Pink noise layers. Detuned oscillators for warmth. Dynamics compression for polish.

Was it overkill? Absolutely. Do I regret it? Not even a little.

## The Accessibility Reckoning

Around week 5, I showed a friend the site. She uses a screen reader.

It... did not go well.

All my fancy effects? Meaningless to her. Worse, some were actively hostile—animations triggered motion sickness, contrast was insufficient, focus states were invisible.

I spent the next week fixing everything:
- Proper ARIA labels
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support
- WCAG AA contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation throughout
- Sound muting (always)

The humbling part? The accessible version is *better*. Constraints forced clearer hierarchy. Focus states became design features. Light mode pushed me to explore new color palettes.

## The Components That Made It

Not everything survived. For every component in production, three died in `/experiments`. But these became the workhorses:

### JellyButton

Physics-based squish on press. Overshoot on release. Surprisingly satisfying.

<ComponentPreview title="Try It" description="Press and release">
  <div className="flex gap-4 flex-wrap justify-center">
    <JellyButton variant="cyber-lime">Cyber Lime</JellyButton>
    <JellyButton variant="cotton-candy">Cotton Candy</JellyButton>
  </div>
</ComponentPreview>

### GlassCard

The workhorse. Three tiers of glass (Mist, Prism, Lume), configurable glow, 3D tilt, shimmer borders.

<ComponentPreview title="Hover to Explore" description="Tilt, spotlight, and shimmer">
  <GlassCard glow="aurora" enableTilt={true} enableShimmer={true} className="p-6 max-w-sm mx-auto">
    <p className="text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 text-sm">Move your cursor around to see the effects.</p>
  </GlassCard>
</ComponentPreview>

## What I'd Do Differently

<Steps>
  <Step title="Design tokens first">
    I waited too long to systematize colors and spacing. Should have done it day one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mobile earlier">
    I built desktop-first and paid for it in responsive fixes. Never again.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ship faster">
    I held off launching until everything was "perfect." It never was. Ship the MVP, iterate publicly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test with real users sooner">
    The accessibility issues would have surfaced earlier with diverse testers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Never-Ending Project

A portfolio is never done. This one will keep evolving:

- More case studies with live demos
- An experiments section for creative coding toys
- Animated theme transitions
- Maybe a secret easter egg or two

But for now? It's shipped. It's live. It's *mine*.

And that feels pretty good.
